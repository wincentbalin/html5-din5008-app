# Create DIN 5008 letters using HTML5

This web app allows you to write German business letters according to the DIN 5008 standard (Form A) using web browser only.

# Usage

Simply copy all files to another server (adjust the paths and the app URL in `manifest.json` and `worker.js` in this case), or simply use the [default instance](https://wincentbalin.github.io/html5-din5008-app/).

Open the URL of the app and install it. Use the button `Print` to print the letter to paper or
to PDF file, and the `Share` button to share the letter as URL. To open a letter with a pre-written text simply share that text with the app.
